**Story**

You are Bob.

You've lived your life alone, happily, for quite some time. You've got a real healthy collection of toilet paper on your property. And if it wasn't for the Zombrona Virus, it would have stayed that way, these damn zombies are obsessed with the stuff.

Keep your toilet paper collection alive!


**Controls**

* WSAD: Move
* Left-Click: Fire
* 1-3: Select Weapon


**Disclaimer**

* For best performance, use the native binaries :) 
* â€‹I apologise, I wasn't able to test the Windows/Linux builds, but if they don't work I'll gladly fix them!



_Made with love using Godot :)_
